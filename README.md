# AI-Experiments
An educational project for experimenting with different types of game AI. 
The types of AI I want to explore in this project are: 
1) Waypoints / Node-based AI
2) FSM (Finite State Machine)
3) Behaviour Tree
4) Utility AI
5) GOAP

Finished experiments with Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra and A*
Now I'm going to make simple Agent patrolling few nodes with A*
